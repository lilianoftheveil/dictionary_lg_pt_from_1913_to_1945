ELUCIDAÇÃO
----------

Em 1911, quando faziamos ainda parte da redacção da _Nação_, reproduzimos naquelle periodico, n.^o 15.255, de 13 de Outubro, a poesia +Salve, Rei!+, de Camillo Castello Branco, de que mandámos tirar uma _separata_, de 32 exemplares numerados, sendo 3 em papel Whatman e os restantes em papel de linho nacional.

Estando todos aquelles exemplares distribuidos, e sendo muitos os camillianistas que desejam possuir a poesia +Salve, Rei!+, resolvemos, sem nenhuns intuitos mercantís, que tambem da primeira vez não tivemos, pois que a edição foi destinada unicamente a offertas, fazer a presente reedição daquella pouco conhecida producção do _Maior de Todos_, como justificadamente os seus mais enthusiastas admiradores cognominaram o auctor do _Amor de Perdição_ e de tantissimas obras que honram a litteratura portugueza.

Eis a razão desta nova _especie_ da extensissima bibliographia camilliana.

Novembro de 1915.

Frazão de Vasconcellos

Nótula da nossa 1.^a edição

A poesia que se segue, dedicada a El-Rei Dom Miguel I, por occasião do seu casamento, foi impressa originalmente, em janeiro de 1852, em uma folha solta, e reproduzida no diario legitimista _A Nação_, n.^o 1834, de 22 de novembro de 1853, em parallelo com uma outra poesia do mesmo Camillo, transcripta do jornal _O Portuense_, de 17 de novembro de 1853, em honra de Dona Maria II, a quando do seu fallecimento.

Na sua preciosa _Bibliographia Camilliana_, refere-se o nosso presado amigo Sr. Henrique Marques a esta pouco conhecida producção do notabilissimo e fecundissimo espirito que foi Camillo Castello Branco, dizendo que viu um exemplar da folha solta, na Bibliotheca Publíca do Porto, e informando mais que o _Jornal da Manhã_, daquella cidade, a reproduziu no seu n.^o 137, de 19 de maio de 1890.

Frazão de Vasconcellos

SALVE, REI!
-----------

Cantor d'outr'ora, quando vi sem flores  
Os magicos jardins da phantasia,  
        Minha lyra depuz.  
Não mais pedi inspirações terrenas.  
Curvei-me ante o altar, sagrei meu estro  
        Aos canticos da cruz.  

E, sem magoa, quebrei prisões da terra,  
Mas uma, se então quiz tambem quebral-a,  
        Não pude… em vão tentei…  
Eram saudades a viver d'esp'ranças,  
Saudades, que nem Deus manda esquecel-as,  
        Saudades do meu Rei!  

Ficava-me no mundo um nome grande,  
Um symbolo d'amor, de luz radiante,  
        Sob um manto real…  
Imagem do que vi na minha infancia,  
Sentado no docel, herança augusta  
        Dos Reis de Portugal  

Christão, pedi com fé—senti que a tinha  
Prostrado ante o altar, quando eu pedi  
        Recursos ao meu Deus…  
Recursos, não pr'a mim que nasci servo,  
Recursos para Vós, Rei desterrado  
        Sob inhospitos céus!—  

Pulsou-me o coração, senti no labio,  
Em vez da oração, soltar-se o hymno  
        D'um peito portuguez!  
Ás lagrimas succede essa alegria  
Dos extasis que á mente imprimem vôos  
        D'energica altivez!  

Rei! no dia em que descestes  
Do Vosso throno real  
Apagou-se a luz da gloria,  
Cerrou-se o livro da historia  
Do Reino de Portugal.  
Surge o anjo do exterminio  
Sobre as trevas infernaes!  
Traz de fogo a fera espada,  
E com mão ensanguentada  
Rasgas as purpuras reaes.  

Sobre o solio dos Affonsos  
Ferreo sceptro esmaga a lei:  
Ruge alli o despotismo  
Se não verga ao servilismo  
Quem lhe diz «Tu não és Rei!»  
Não és Rei! és uma affronta  
Feita ao povo portuguez!  
Não és Rei que não herdaste  
Este chão que escravisaste  
A quem falso Rei te fez!  

Vaga o anjo do exterminio  
Como inspiração do algoz!  
Corações com Vossa imagem,  
Oh meu Rei! são a carnagem  
Do punhal que fere atroz!  
Foram dias de martyrio,  
De terror e maldição!  
Mas o martyr, expirando,  
Esquecia-Vos só quando  
Lhe morria o coração!  

Vaga o anjo do exterminio  
Do mosteiro sobre a cruz,  
E roçando a negra aza  
Pela cruz o templo arraza  
E do altar extingue a luz.  
Cospe injurias e sarcasmo  
Sobre a face do ancião,  
Porque orava, é réo, e expulso  
Foge á morte, e cede ao impulso  
De penuria, e pede pão.  

Pede o pão que amassa em pranto  
De saudades que crê vem  
D'uma cella que comprára  
Quando o mundo cá deixára  
Com as pompas que elle tem!  
Pede o pão que lhe usurparam  
Com tamanho desamor…  
Fraco, ao vêr que chega a morte,  
Morre… e então mostra que é forte  
Perdoando ao matador!  

Lá, no campo da carnagem,  
Mutilado um corpo jaz…  
Ficaram-lhe alli seus ossos…  
Pois que foi um d'entre os Vossos  
Real Senhor! não terá paz.  
Nem a paz dos que morreram  
Sem a nodoa da traição  
Nem a paz da sepultura  
Ao fiel que honrado jura  
Morrer sob o seu pendão  

Lá se abraça ao corpo exangue  
No abandono da viuvez  
A que alli vive arrastada  
Mendigando, envergonhada,  
Improperios… talvez!  
Pobre, e só, mãe de tres filhos  
Quando a fome a constrangeu,  
Inda assim, um pensamento,  
Uma esperança, um grato alento  
Foi por Vós que o concebeu…  

Vaga o anjo do exterminio  
Enverga o manto real;  
D'um diadema a fronte cinge,  
Mas o sangue que lh'o tinge  
Brada vingança fatal!  
N'essa fronte ensanguentada  
Escreveu a mão de Deus!…  
Mas tambem homens puzeram  
Inscripções onde se leram  
Infamias como tropheus!  

Oh Rei de Portugal! Quando a amargura  
D'este povo infeliz, é sem conforto,  
        Valemo-nos do céu!  
Pedimos-lhe por Vós, anjo proscripto,  
Pedimos-lhe vigor á doce espr'ança  
        Que em vós o céu nos deu!  

Vireis, Senhor vireis, que Deus é justo!  
Vireis enxugar lagrimas amargas  
        Que se choram por Vós!  
Sereis de todos Pae, não vingativo,  
E nós todos irmãos, e Vós de todos…  
        O Rei de todos nós!  

Fatidica aureola circumda  
Nas plagas do desterro dolorosas  
        Vossa fronte real.  
Sentado sobre as rochas da montanha  
Lá mesmo na solidão d'amargo exilio  
        Sois Rei de Portugal!  

Deu-vos um anjo a Providencia augusta  
Em galardão á dôr que amargurastes  
        Com Santa intrepidez.  
Um dia curvaremos o joelho  
Perante Essa que o ceu fadou Rainha  
        Do povo portuguez.

1.F.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit [www.gutenberg.org/donate](https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/).

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: [www.gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
